            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was the parable of <hi>Pythogoras, Cor ne edito,</hi> eate not thy Heart, which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, although in it ſelfe it bee obſcure; yet by the Sunſhine of friendſhip, the Miſt of obſcurity is diſperſed,
<pb facs="tcp:2063:10"/>
and the true meaning of the Author thus plainely to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that thoſe which want friends to reveale ſecrets, or open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto, are devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their owne hearts. So great an Enemy to man is this his ſecret hatred, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to ſocietie, that it cauſeth him to degenerate; degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to participate of the nature of Savage Beaſts, to become a Caniball, a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer not of others but of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2063:10"/>
If affliction ſhould ayme at me, and I fall in company, a Friend may raiſe me againe, but <hi>vae ſoli,</hi> woe unto <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 10.</note> him that is alone; woe unto him that is given over unto himſelfe, for he falleth, and there is not a ſecond to lift him up.</p>
            <p>The Proverbe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>One man's deemed none,</hi> meanes, <hi>Life is death where men do live alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miſery, it lookes merrily, ſo long as it may repaire to ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:2063:11"/>
will affoord it mercy; for it eaſeth a grieved heart to ſee his friend pity him, who in pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth partake with him; And therefore not unfitly did the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> call friends <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipes curarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will here ſhew you two notable examples of the uſe of Friends, and tryall of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; The firſt betwixt <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> whoſe ſoules were knit together with the band of Amity: <hi>Ionathan</hi> you may ſee, in the
<pb facs="tcp:2063:11"/>
firſt of <hi>Samuel.</hi> 19. 2. would not keepe his owne fathers counſell when it was againſt <hi>David</hi> his Friend, but revealed the plot to <hi>David; Saul, my Father, goeth about to ſlay thee:</hi> Yea, and he wrought ſo for him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that he brought him againe into the preſence of <hi>Saul,</hi> his Father, as in time paſt. <hi>verſe</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve what would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the man ſicke of the Palſie (in the 5.
<pb facs="tcp:2063:12"/>
of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel and 18. <hi>verſe)</hi> if he had had no Friends, he was too feeble of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to crowd into the houſe, yea, his Friends, though men of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet at firſt could find no way to helpe him; but at laſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh it were through the tyleing, they found way to let downe <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum out miſerecordem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I cannot omit a third example, and <note place="margin">Tyb. <hi>ad</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianum, <hi>haec pro amicitia noſtra, non occultaui.</hi>
               </note> that of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> with whom <hi>Sejanus</hi> had aſcended, to that
<pb facs="tcp:2063:12"/>
height of Friendſhip, that they two were reckoned as a paire of Friends, and the whole Senate did dedicate an Altar to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as to a Goddeſſe, in reſpect of the great and intire Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip betwixt theſe two. So deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is Trve Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that when a man cannot find comfort in any other Cordiall whatſoever, then this is a Cordiall comfort to him, That he hath a Friend will eaſe his
<pb facs="tcp:2063:13"/>
heart by taking part with him. A man may <note place="margin">Francis <hi>Lord</hi> Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</note> take <hi>Sarza</hi> to open the Liver, <hi>Steele</hi> to open the Spleene, Flower of <hi>Sulphur</hi> for the Lungs, <hi>Castoreum</hi> for the Braine, but no receipt openeth the Heart but a true Friend to whom a man may boldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whatſoever lieth upon the Heart to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it.</p>
            <p>Wee now ſee of what uſe a good Friend is, and what need there is of him; but I confeſſe it is a difficult thing
<pb facs="tcp:2063:13"/>
for us in this deceitful <note place="margin">Defficilia quae pudera.</note> time, to find out ſuch a Friend; but what if ſuch a Friend ſhould come and proffer us this kindneſſe, as with <hi>Ionathan,</hi> to knit His ſoule to the ſoules of us, that are <hi>Davids,</hi> the beloved of the Lord; would wee not accept of this Friend-like proffer? So it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath proffered Himſelfe, and hath promiſed, that if wee will unite our ſelues with Him, in this league of Amitie, that
<pb facs="tcp:2063:14"/>
although wee have ſo highly offended His Father, and by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions plucked His wrath upon our heads; Yet hee will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſatisfie His Iuſtice, appeaſe this His wrath, and avert His ire. Although by our depraved nature, wee have deprived our ſelues of His preſence; Yet Hee will pleade ſo well for us, that wee ſhall againe be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into His preſence, as in times paſt.</p>
            <p>It was the ſpeech of
<pb facs="tcp:2063:14"/>
an Emperour (as I take it upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) That hee had <note place="margin">Severus.</note> had all things, and now would give all things to be found in <hi>Christ:</hi> Now wee have on the contrary <hi>Christ</hi> freely offering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and uſing all meanes poſſible to win us vnto Himſelfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting us to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of His trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; And becauſe wee ſhall know that wee are not Friends, in the meaneſt ranke, or degree of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb facs="tcp:2063:15"/>
Hee is pleaſed not onely to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, but alſo to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie us by a more neere, deere, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar title, as, His ſiſter, His ſpouſe, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 1.

               <p>It was anſwered by one of the old <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> in <hi>Laertius,</hi> being asked when a young

to the <hi>Devill,</hi> who doth deadly loath us; Let us now judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be better to be beloved of a friend, or loathed of a fiend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtin</hi> ſaith, That this our <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> the Devill, is <hi>Dei Simia,</hi> Gods Ape, and indeed this word Ape, doth very well agree with him in this reſpect; Even as the Ape by kindneſſe kills her whelpe; with too much love, and lulling in her armes: So will not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than then denie us

helpe, when as his help may yeeld us greater harmes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amando occidit,</hi> his love is their death, whoever they are, hee once commeth to hug, or imbrace; not much unlike to <hi>Ammon,</hi> who after he had once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred his ſiſter <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> he hated her ever after; And wee ſhall find, that what ſhow of love ſoever this our Enemie hath made to us before, Yet his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred after, will be farre greater, <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the

elder, noted very well, when ſeeing his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very old, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriken in yeeres, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to marry a young ſtripling; that althogh it were in her power to violate the Lawes of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> yet not to violate the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So let me tell you; That although it may ſeeme eaſie in your conceit, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the lawes of men, yet ſhall it not be eaſie to violate the lawes of God, by whoſe edict it ſtands decreed; That
<pb facs="tcp:2063:33"/>
either wee muſt be His Spouſe, or the Devills harlot; with the one wee ſhall find Treaſure incomparable, with the other trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, of the one, wee ſhall find a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treaſure, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pernitious tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; Wee can deſire no more then the firſt, if wee refuſe the laſt, and wee can deſerue no leſſe then the laſt, if wee refuſe the firſt.</p>
               <p>I believe not that wee can juſtly tax <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpias</hi> the mother of

                  <hi>My Love, and faire one, &amp;c.</hi> Hence let us take notice that wee are His, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am His;</hi> Verſe, 16. Yea, if wee rightly conſider it, wee are more His then our owne; and therefore wee ſhould haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a greater care to pleaſe Him, then to pleaſe our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo may we obſerue the happineſſe of true believers above others; They alone ſhall participate of
<pb facs="tcp:2063:34"/>
this His extraordinary Love, whereas others ſhall be excluded this heavenly Paradice, as Harlots, not worthy to be received, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive their portion with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and his Angels for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Love, &amp;c.</hi> Here wee ſee, Hee pleaſeth to ſpeake in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, to let us underſtand that He hath but one <hi>Love,</hi> but one true Church, as therefore, hee will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no other, no

more ought wee: <hi>There ſhall bee but one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and one ſheep-fold.</hi> Wee read of none but wicked <hi>Lamech</hi> before the flood, that had more wives then one, and him <hi>Iovinnian</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Monſter, becauſe he made two ribs of one; Yea, and another obſerueth, that the name of his ſecond wife did ſignifie a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, becauſe that ſhee was not a wife, but the ſhadow of a wife, So in like manner, there is but one Catholike
<pb facs="tcp:2063:35"/>
Church, the Roman, ſome thinke, no better then <hi>Lamech's</hi> ſecond wife, but the ſhadow of a wife; but admit her <hi>Christs</hi> ſpouſe, yet ſhee hath many foule faults in her, much le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie and wantonneſſe, which God amend: But becauſe this will deprive me of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſcourſe, I therefore leave it, and come againe to the ſame words before handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Love and faire one, &amp;c.</hi> Here is both a

likely portion, and a lovely proportion; ſhe is both lovely &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. Here is His love expreſſed to his church in many more words then his Anger, which laſteth but a while, but this His love ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, She is not now his ſiſter only, but His Spouſe alſo; not onely His Spouſe, but alſo His Love; and not His Love alone, but His Faire-one; Faire, firſt in reſpect of Her Beauty; ſecondly, in reſpect of her Order
<pb facs="tcp:2063:36"/>
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Behold, thou art faire my Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art faire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of Her Beauty; The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts of Grace doe ſhine more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Her; Her jmage which was before by nature defaced, is now againe revived; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Her doth now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her former perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore, when He had reckoned Her beautifull parts in particular, as, <hi>Thine</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Order, which is the Beauty of every thing, for where no Order is, there is deformity, and where Order is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there is comelines. If you heare but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Oration, will ye not judge the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the beauty thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:2063:37"/>
rather to conſiſt in the curious compoſing, or knitting together of thoſe Rhetoricall flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the flowers or ſentences the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves. It is ſo in every Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; An Army mixed together is a confuſed multitude, but in their Order, a beautifull company. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Queene of <hi>Sheba,</hi> that came ſo far to ſee <hi>Solomon,</hi> that when ſhe beheld the ſitting of his ſervants, and the attendance of his Miniſters, and their
<pb facs="tcp:2063:38"/>
apparell, and his Cup-bearers, &amp;c. There was no more ſpirit in her, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 4, 5. She was raviſhed here, with the very Order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of him that was but a type of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church, then whoſe Order, nothing is more beautifull. Wherein, every one affecteth not Supremacy, but ſome bare one Office, and ſome another; ſome <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome workers of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſome Heare, ſome reade, ſome Preach, ſome</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2063:38"/>
                  <hi>Pray, every one do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having mixt her Beauty with order, you ſee in what a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull order the <hi>Church</hi> remaines.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>invitavit cum</hi>

towards Him, and cry Him mercy, that wee have beene ſo long diſobedient, and have ſo long ſtopped our eares at His call; let us now run and cary with us, <hi>Gemitum in pectore; Singulttm in gutture, Fletum in facie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Groanes in our breſt, Sighes in our throats, Teares in our eyes; let there no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger be need for Him to cry, <hi>How long would I, but ye would not?</hi> But let us now haſt to meet Him who comes not to leade us
<pb facs="tcp:2063:39"/>
out of priſon, to the place of execution, but to a place of joy inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which as he is willing, ſo alſo is hee able to beſtow upon us.</p>
               <p>There are but three kingdomes, <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and he is Lord and Maſter of them all.

He is Lord of <hi>Hell, ad domandum</hi> to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it.</p>
               <p>And this is that Lordly Bridegroome, betwixt whom and us, the Covenants were drawne in Baptiſme, and have oft ſince bin ſealed and confirmed in the Lords Supper.
